For the past 5 years, I have been using different kinds of distributed systems to solve production problems. Read some books, paper, blogs; maintained Hadoop, HBase cluster for some time. Wrote this blog to act like a map to navigate among these resources. 

Github already has a similar page that listed related resources for distributed systems.

# Concepts
## Failing mode
* ``Byzantine fault modle`` - Comes from the Byzantine generals problem invented by Lamport. To put it simple, some of the nodes within a cluster may not be reliable that they may **present different symptoms to different observers** to cause the failure of reaching a concensus among the cluster.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault
* https://academy.binance.com/blockchain/byzantine-fault-tolerance-explained 

* ``crash-recovery failure model`` - In practice, most systems assume a crash-recovery failure model: that is, nodes can only fail by crashing, and can (possibly) recover after crashing at some later point.

## Consensus

Frameworks
* [RAFT](https://raft.github.io/)

## Consistency

* [CMU Consitency slide](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~srini/15-446/S09/lectures/10-consistency.pdf)

## Replication

Blog
* https://blog.yugabyte.com/how-does-consensus-based-replication-work-in-distributed-databases/


Replication - Theory and Practice - effective replication is the heart of modern distributed systems and this theme is covered well in this book.
Introduction to Distributed Algorithms: Gerard Tel: 9780521794831: Amazon.com: Books - this book has very deep theoretical explanation of classical distributed algorithms.
